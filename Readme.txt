paper 1:

Title: Low-frequency near-field interferometry for characterization of lossy dielectric and an investigation on sea ice
All codes are available in paper1.zip

paper 2:
Title: Development of an experimental model of low frequency dipole radiation in the presence of multilayered structures

paper3:
Title: Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Characterization of Layered Media Using Deep Neural Network

paper4:
Title: Estimation of Thickness and Dielectric Characteristics of Sea Ice from Near-Field EM Measurements Using Deep Learning for Large Scale Polar Ice Probing

All codes are available here, and they are made public. If anyone finds difficulty while running the codes, please mail to me:
shifatbuet@gmail.com, shifatul@anyeshan.com.

if someone finds these codes helpful in their own research, we request to cite our works, which would really mean a lot to the team. :)

Thank you
